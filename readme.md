This script will automatically dial while your net are broken.

Where the script will dial to is Dr.com, since I found my computer in dialing to access campus networks will dial to Dr.com.

## How to use

Run the executable file 'dial.exe'.
It will redial automatically.

### Must to do
* You must make a file called 'config.txt' in the same folder for 'dial.exe'. (The definition of 'config.txt' is bellow.)

|Line index|Meaning|
|:---:|:---:|
|1|username|
|2|password|
|3|waitting time|

* `waitting time` means the interval of two dial processes, with unit is second.
